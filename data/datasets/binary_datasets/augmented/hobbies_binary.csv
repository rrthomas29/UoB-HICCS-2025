Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 eggs (beaten)
- 2 cups milk
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a bundt pan or large loaf pan with some of the butter and dust it lightly with flour.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt to combine well. 
3. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the beaten eggs into it. Start incorporating them by pulling in the flour with a wooden spoon or spatula until just combined. Avoid overmixing as this can result in tough cake texture.
4. Gradually pour the milk and remaining butter, alternating between each addition (dry/wet) while continuously stirring. Continue to mix until all ingredients are incorporated and you have a smooth batter with no lumps. 
5. Pour the batter into your prepared bundt or loaf pan, smoothing out the top with a spatula.
6. Bake for about 40-50 minutes in the preheated oven until the cake is golden brown and springs back when lightly pressed on its surface. A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean or with just a few crumbs attached, indicating that it's fully baked through.
7. Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes in the pan before transferring the cake onto a wire rack to finish cooling completely. If you used a bundt pan, allow the cake to sit inverted on the rack until cooled.
8. Once fully cooled, you can serve it plain or dust with powdered sugar. Enjoy your homemade buttermilk cake!"

Yes, an alternative could be ""USA, remember to keep"". This maintains the essence of the original phrase while changing its structure slightly.

One way to do this is by adjusting punctuation and capitalization: ""For that rationale, USA: remember to keep"". The colon adds emphasis, suggesting a reminder of significant importance. However, the length remains similar to the original text as per your instruction. 

**Follow-up questions and answers for Instruction_shuffling:**  
1. Can you demonstrate an example where we also change the number?

**Follow-up Questions:**  

Q1: Can you explain how this revised sentence maintains semantic integrity while using different word choices?
A1: Absol cuhns in completely before adding the hardening agent. The phrase ""employed vivid crimson"" replaces ""used bright red,"" as both convey a strong, intense color being utilized. Similarly, ""blending the hue completely prior to incorporating"" serves the same function as ""mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding,"" indicating thorough integration of materials before proceeding with an additional component for setting or hardening purposes.

Q2: How do you ensure that the revised text remains faithful to the context and purpose of the original?
A2: To remain faithful to the context, I identified key concepts from the original sentence—such as color intensity (""bright red"" with ""vivid crimson""), the process of mixing or blending, and adding a hardening agent. By selecting synonyms that carry similar connotations and preserving the sequence of actions (mixing then adding), the revised text stays true to the original's intent while demonstrating variations in language use.
