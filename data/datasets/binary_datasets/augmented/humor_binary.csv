Remember to retain a balance between preserving semantic meaning and introducing minor variations in wording. This could be achieved through strategies such as replacing words with their synonyms or slightly altering sentence structure while enscribing the same contextual information. For instance, 'That ain't too bad,' has been revised to 'Sure, it isn't too terrible', where 'too bad' is replaced by its synonymous phrase 'not good'. Similarly, 'expectin'' has been transformed into 'except for', providing a similar connotation but with different wording. Additionally, the company being ""so busy"" was restated as ""being so occupied"". The key idea of companies never getting to do anything due to their workload is maintained in both phrases.
